# Description

This role configures a set of Systemd timers that build configured branches of [nimbus-eth2]() and push the built docker images.

# Configuration

The minimal configuration would look something like:
```yaml
# Branch to build and frequency
beacon_node_builds_branches:
  - name: 'xyz'
    version: 'feature/xyz'
    targets: ['nimbus_beacon_node', 'nimbus_signing_process']
    frequency: '*-*-* 02:00:00'

# Required to push Docker images
beacon_node_builds_docker_hub_user: 'docker-hub-user'
beacon_node_builds_docker_hub_token: 'super-secret-password'
```

# Management

You can check the status of the timers using:
```
 > sudo systemctl list-timers 'beacon-node-build-*'
