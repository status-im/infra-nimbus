# Description

The files here are Ansible inventory files generated by [`ansible/terraform.py`](/ansible/terraform.py).

Their purpose is an emergency inventory backup in case of failure or unavailability of Consul.

# Usage

To use simply provide the file for the given stage using the `-i` argument.

For example, if you want to run Ansible on mailservers of `eth.test` fleet while Consul is unavailable do:
```bash
ansible-playbook ansible/main.yml -i ansible/inventory/test -l mail
```

# Terraform Backup

In addition to the Ansible inventory files the [`ansible/terraform.py`](/ansible/terraform.py) script also stores the last seen Terraform inventory under `.terraform/terraform.tfstate.backup`.

So if ever Consul KV store is lost, it can be recovered from this copy.
